### Origins

These articles are the observations of another being on subjects considering the body and the mind. The world is a vast place and via abstract thinking Eudemonis explores the hills and valleys that is called a human life. Written with the human condition it hopes to spark inspiration and conversation. Eudmonis invites you to share your thoughts.


The world is an enormeous place, with plenty of sights to see, mountains to climb and galaxies to explore. Science has shown us that the things we see and think of as big and small are in fact both. A pyramid compared to an ant is the same as the sun compared to the earth. And what is an ant compared to the whole earth? It will never be able to walk the perimeter of the earth with its own legs in its short life time. At Eudemonis we think believe that what holds true on a small scale holds true on a large scale as well and vice versa. 


_Eudaimonia_ is a Greek word commonly translated as happiness or welfare. Eudaimonia implies a positive and divine state of being that humanity is able to strive toward and possibly reach.

Etymologically, it consists of the words _"eu"_ ("good") and _"daim≈çn"_ ("spirit").

In Aristotle's works, _eudaimonia_ (based on older Greek tradition) was used as the term for the highest human good, and so it is the aim of practical philosophy, including ethics and political philosophy, to consider (and also experience) what it really is, and how it can be achieved.
