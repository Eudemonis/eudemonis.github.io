Today is finally the day that this blog is coming online. I have absolutely no idea what to write about so I thought I'll just make some lists instead. Maybe that will spark my creativity eventually and it might be a nice way to introduce myself.

Things I like to do that are considered weird:
1. Eating frozen bread
2.

Things I dislike about myself:
1. That my first reaction is: "What is there not to dislike?"

Things I like about myself:
1. That I changed hate into dislike in the previous list. Shows some sort of self-love or at least honesty and thoughtfulness.

This is so cool! I really love markdown!

And then this happens
