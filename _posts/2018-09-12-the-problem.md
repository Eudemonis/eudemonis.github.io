I dedicated this blog, and with that more or less my life, to search for (the) truth. For a start I do not even know if it is <i>my</i> truth, <i>a</i> truth or simply <i>the</i> truth. Maybe I should write Truth, with a capital, like many philosophers and guru's talking as if they know everything. And maybe they do, but I don't.
