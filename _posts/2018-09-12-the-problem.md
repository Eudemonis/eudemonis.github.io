**I:** sometimes describe myself as chaotic, sometimes as lost and at other times simply as having no purpose. Different words more or less describing the same thing - a feeling that I'm blind to something that seems so obvious to others.

I dedicated this blog, and with that more or less my life, to search for (the) truth. For a start I do not even know if it is <i>my</i> truth, <i>a</i> truth or simply <i>the</i> truth. Maybe I should write Truth, with a capital, like many philosophers and guru's talking as if they know everything. And maybe they do, but I don't. And it becomes even more frustrating knowing that they might be right, but I'm incapable, or blind, or not old enough to get it yet. Anyway, like I said before, I feel like I'm missing out on something. And like many of my age I hate that feeling. So in a way to get to the bottom of all of this I dedicate this very first post to this problem that arose from my life.
