title: Finding something I truly enjoy
---

On some days I give myself the opportunity to pursue absolutely anything that I would like to do. I have no tasks and no appointments, I have complete freedom. And that what do I do more often than not is getting frustrated.

## Matching 
I know I enjoy many things, and I like to do them all at once, but my attention can only focus on one thing at the time. I believe that every moment has its matching 'activity' (includes doing nothing). Here is a tip if I can't seem to find that match: A squandering or frustrated mind is a mind focused on things that do not matter. Do a full stop (see description below) to restart the system and start doing the thing that comes to my attention that feels good and brings me joy just thinking about it. 

Focus on it. And when I notice I get frustrated or irritated it is a sign the task is finished for now. So I advice to unfocus once again. I'm reminding you that tasks don't have to be done as quickly as possible, nor take the whole day. For example, when I'm coding I know there will come a time when my body starts to ache, my feet grow cold, but my head is as hot as a freshly cooked curry. The time has come to switch to another task, or maybe take a break. Perfect example: I don't journal all day long, at some point I get too excited to do thins so I can journal about it later! 

## Curing frustration
Enjoying the activity itself is probably more important to me than its result. It's easier said than done, enjoying things. I'll know when I'm truly enjoying it, even if I can't imagine anything right now. Take a moment to rest, or decide to do exactly that which you feel you need to do. It could even be five things at the same time. I should do them as badly as I wish to do, or with as much attention as I wish to do it. I could decide to lie down for the rest of the day, that everything can screw itself. Hopefully there will come a moment of clarity in which the thing that brings me joy will present itself and devote myself to it wholeheartedly. 

## Full stop 
For a brief moment, do absolutely nothing. Put everything aside, even food, tea or a loading website. Just stop everything. Sit back and don't take any action physically or mentally.
